### Basic HTML
#### basic sections of a document
- header
- navigation bar
- main content
- side bar
- footer
#### HTML for structuring content
To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:
- -header: <header>.
- -navigation bar: <nav>.
- -main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
- -sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside <main>.
- -footer: <footer>.
#### HTML layout elements in more detail
  - -semantic wrappers
  - -Non-semantic wrappers
      span,div
  ### Font
  #### font loading strategies
  - FOUT with Class – Best approach for most situations. (This works whether we use a font-hosting company or hosting our own fonts.)
  - Critical FOFT – Most performant approach. (This only works if we host our own fonts.)
  #### Loading fonts with cloud-hosted fonts
  - <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.typekit.net/your-kit-id.css">

### I have to finish and submit the Dated Journal Entry today.
### I learnt Colour, typography and visual hierarchy.
1. Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements and influence in the order you want your users to view them. By using principles like contrast, scale, balance and, more, you can help establish each element in its rightful place and help the most important elements stand out.
2. Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
